This year, Ocean Park is working with AiR Metaverse to deliver the first ever Online + Offline Ocean Park Halloween experience in which visitors can play through a fascinating story BEFORE, DURING, and AFTER the event. A cast of sea animals dress up in wonderful Halloween costumes to become the first of many upcoming AiR Citizen NFT collection!",

Together, AiR Citizens populate the world of AiR and turn the Metaverse into a NFT playground across different brands and creators. NFT hodlers can utilize their AiR Citizens to participate in a great variety of game plays, to go to work at the different NFT-based AiR buildings, to form adventure teams to explore real world locations, and to be used as loyalty qualifications for Play-to-Earn opportunities.",
    tc03: "Ocean Park collaborates with AiR Metaverse to deliver “Metaverse-to-Go”, which adds Metaverse experience into the physical theme park for augmented entertainment through Metaverse gateways, accessible with the AiR Metaverse mobile app. Through AiR Metaverse, Ocean Park is extended into digital space in the form of a fantasy game world, where visitors can embark on an Adventure-in-Reality that crosses the boundaries between virtual and physical, to enjoy a journey that is fun and rewarding. In this unique digital world of adventure, visitors can play the roles of Panda care-takers, protectors of sea animals, or even heroes who are to defeat Halloween monsters to save both the virtual and physical worlds!",
